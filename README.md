# ECG Data Processing Library

**ECG Data Processing Library** is a JavaScript library designed for analyzing and processing ECG data. It provides tools for filtering noise, detecting key PQRST waveforms, and calculating clinical indicators such as PR interval, QRS duration, and heart rate.

## Features
- Noise filtering (high-pass, low-pass, and notch filters)
- Detection and extraction of PQRST waves
- Calculation of PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and heart rate
- Real-time and batch ECG signal processing
- Configurable for different sampling rates and heart rates

## Installation
Install the library using npm:
```bash
npm install ecg-data-processor
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of using the library:
```javascript
const ecgProcessor = require('ecg-data-processor');

const ecgData = [ 0.05, 0.1,  0.15, ...];  // ECG data points [time (ms), voltage]
const processedData = ecgProcessor.process(ecgData);

console.log(processedData);
```

## Usage 
### Example
The following example demonstrates how to use the library to process ECG data:
1. Prepare your ECG voltage(usually between -1.5mV ~ 1.5mV) data in a text file (e.g., ecg.txt), where each line represents a single data point (a numeric value). For example:
```text
0.061165
0.075489
0.089244
0.100792
0.10895099999999999
0.11308700000000001
0.11303
0.109092
...
```
3. Process the data using the library in your code:
```javascript
import { process } from 'ecg-data-process';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// Read ECG data from a file
const filePath = path.resolve('test/ecg.txt');
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');

// Parse ECG data
const ecgData = fileContent.split('\n').map(line => {
    return line.trim() * 1;
});

// Process the data with a specific frequency (e.g., 511.547 Hz)
const processedData = process(ecgData, 511.547);

// Get the result
const processedResult = processedData.getResult();

console.log(processedResult.summary);
console.log(processedResult.segments[0].beats[0]);
```
### Output
The processed result will provide the following summary:
```json
{
  "hr": 81,
  "st": 0.0881,
  "pr": 143.68,
  "qrs": 137.17
}
```

* HR: Heart Rate (beats per minute)
* ST: ST segment (seconds)
* PR: PR interval (milliseconds)
* QRS: QRS duration (milliseconds)

The processed result will also provide the following beats:
```json

### Options Description
all options are optional, you can use the default values if you don't want to change them.

- **debug**: `boolean` (default: `false`)
    - Enables or disables debug mode. When set to `true`, additional log information will be output for troubleshooting or analysis purposes.

- **aggregation**: `number` (default: `Math.floor(frequency / 100)`)
  - The number of data points to aggregate, which helps block high-frequency noise in the ECG data. A higher value means more aggregation, reducing noise but potentially losing fine details. The default value is based on the sampling frequency of the data.

- **rPeakSlopeThreshold**: `number` (default: `0.05`)
    - The threshold for detecting the slope of R-peaks in the ECG waveform. Lower values may result in more sensitive peak detection, while higher values will detect fewer peaks.

- **rPeakMinDistance**: `number` (default: `30`)
    - The minimum distance (in data points) between consecutive R-peaks. This prevents false R-peak detection when two peaks are too close to each other.

- **smoothWindowSize**: `number` (default: `5`)
    - The window size for the smoothing function applied to the ECG data. A larger window results in more smoothing, but may reduce the clarity of certain waveforms.

- **baselineFilter**: `enum` (default: `LOWPASS`)
  - The filter used to remove baseline wander from the ECG signal. It can take the following values:
    - `LOWPASS`: A low-pass filter to smooth out high-frequency noise (default).
    - `MEDIAN`: A median filter for removing noise while preserving sharp edges.
    - `MEAN`: A mean filter for averaging nearby values.

  Users can select a filter by importing the available filters:
  ```javascript
  import { filters } from 'ecg-data-process';
  const filter = filters.LOWPASS; // Example
  ```

- **baselineFilterOptions**: `object`
  - The configuration options for the selected baseline filter:
    - **alpha**: `number` (default: `0.05`)
      - Used when the `LOWPASS` filter is selected. It controls the smoothing factor, with lower values providing smoother output by giving more weight to previous data points.
    - **windowSize**: `number` (default: `20`)
      - Used when the `MEDIAN` or `MEAN` filters are selected. It determines the number of data points considered for filtering.

- **throughMinDistance**: `number` (default: `10`)
    - The minimum distance (in data points) between consecutive troughs in the ECG waveform. This ensures that noise or small variations do not cause false detection of troughs.
